A Python-based tool that integrates classical machine learning with quantum computing (via Qiskit) to identify anomalies in datasets, such as fraud detection, system errors, or unusual events.

ðŸš€ Features
    Supports CSV input for structured datasets
    Combines classical PCA with a simple quantum circuit to enhance feature space
    Visualizes anomaly scores
    Modular and easy to extend

ðŸ§  Tech Stack
    Python
    NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn
    Qiskit (for quantum circuit simulation)

ðŸ“¦ Setup
    1. Clone the repo or download the ZIP
    2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
    3. Run the script: python quantum_anomaly.py
